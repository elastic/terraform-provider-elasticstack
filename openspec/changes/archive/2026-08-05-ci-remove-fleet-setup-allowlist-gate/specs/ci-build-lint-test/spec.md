## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Acceptance test job structure (REQ-009–REQ-014)

The matrix acceptance test job SHALL depend on successful completion of the `build` job and the change-classification job. The acceptance test job SHALL run with a non-fail-fast matrix covering configured stack versions and included version-specific overrides. The configured stack versions SHALL NOT include Elastic Stack versions below `8.0.0`. The acceptance test job SHALL configure required environment variables for Elastic credentials and experimental provider behavior. The acceptance test job SHALL execute only when the change-classification job reports `provider_changes=true`.

For each matrix entry, the job SHALL free disk space, set up Go and Terraform, run `make vendor`, start the stack via Docker Compose, and wait for Elasticsearch and Kibana readiness. Fleet Server host, agent policy, and package policy setup SHALL be provided by the Docker Compose stack start (`make docker-fleet`) and by the acceptance test PreCheck's default agent download source bootstrap, without any additional per-version-gated Fleet setup step. Forced synthetics installation SHALL run only for configured version subsets. Acceptance tests SHALL run via `make testacc`, with snapshot versions allowed to fail (`continue-on-error`) while non-snapshot versions remain blocking.

The stack-start step SHALL have a step-level timeout so that a hung container image pull fails fast instead of consuming the full job timeout.

#### Scenario: Provider change runs stack and tests

- **GIVEN** a matrix version and runner
- **AND** the change-classification job reports `provider_changes=true`
- **WHEN** the test job executes
- **THEN** the stack SHALL be provisioned, readiness waits SHALL pass, and `make testacc` SHALL run with the documented policy for snapshots

#### Scenario: OpenSpec-only change skips matrix acceptance

- **GIVEN** a workflow run whose changed files are all under `openspec/`
- **WHEN** the acceptance test job evaluates its execution conditions
- **THEN** the matrix acceptance `test` job SHALL be skipped

#### Scenario: Compose step timeout prevents hung pull

- **GIVEN** Docker Compose is starting the stack for a matrix entry
- **AND** a container image pull or stack startup hangs
- **WHEN** the configured step timeout is reached
- **THEN** the step SHALL fail and the job SHALL exit early

#### Scenario: Matrix excludes 7.x stack versions

- **WHEN** the acceptance matrix is evaluated
- **THEN** every configured stack version SHALL be `8.0.0` or higher, except snapshot labels that represent later unreleased stack versions

#### Scenario: Fleet bootstrap runs uniformly for every matrix entry

- **GIVEN** any configured matrix version, including one that is not part of any explicit per-version allowlist
- **WHEN** the test job starts the stack via `make docker-fleet`
- **THEN** a default Fleet Server host, a `fleet-server` agent policy, and a `fleet_server` package policy SHALL exist before `make testacc` runs
- **AND** `make testacc`'s `acctest.PreCheck` SHALL ensure a default agent download source exists
- **AND** no separate per-version-gated Fleet setup step SHALL be required for this coverage
