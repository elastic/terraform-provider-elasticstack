# Data Source: elasticstack_elasticsearch_ingest_processor_dissect

Similar to the Grok Processor, dissect also extracts structured fields out of a single text field within a document. However unlike the Grok Processor, dissect does not use Regular Expressions. This allows dissectâ€™s syntax to be simple and for some cases faster than the Grok Processor.

Dissect matches a single text field against a defined pattern.
