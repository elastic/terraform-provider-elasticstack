# Data Source: elasticstack_elasticsearch_ingest_processor_date

Helper data source to which can be used to parse dates from fields, and then uses the date or timestamp as the timestamp for the document. 
By default, the date processor adds the parsed date as a new field called `@timestamp`. You can specify a different field by setting the `target_field` configuration parameter. Multiple date formats are supported as part of the same date processor definition. They will be used sequentially to attempt parsing the date field, in the same order they were defined as part of the processor definition.

See: https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/date-processor.html

## Example Usage

Here is an example that adds the parsed date to the `timestamp` field based on the `initial_date` field:
