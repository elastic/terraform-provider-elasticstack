# Data Source: elasticstack_elasticsearch_ingest_processor_network_direction

Calculates the network direction given a source IP address, destination IP address, and a list of internal networks.

The network direction processor reads IP addresses from Elastic Common Schema (ECS) fields by default. If you use the ECS, only the `internal_networks` option must be specified.


One of either `internal_networks` or `internal_networks_field` must be specified. If `internal_networks_field` is specified, it follows the behavior specified by `ignore_missing`.

### Supported named network rangese

The named ranges supported for the internal_networks option are:

* `loopback` - Matches loopback addresses in the range of 127.0.0.0/8 or ::1/128.
* `unicast` or `global_unicast` - Matches global unicast addresses defined in RFC 1122, RFC 4632, and RFC 4291 with the exception of the IPv4 broadcast address (255.255.255.255). This includes private address ranges.
* `multicast` - Matches multicast addresses.
* `interface_local_multicast` - Matches IPv6 interface-local multicast addresses.
* `link_local_unicast` - Matches link-local unicast addresses.
* `link_local_multicast` - Matches link-local multicast addresses.
* `private` - Matches private address ranges defined in RFC 1918 (IPv4) and RFC 4193 (IPv6).
* `public` - Matches addresses that are not loopback, unspecified, IPv4 broadcast, link local unicast, link local multicast, interface local multicast, or private.
* `unspecified` - Matches unspecified addresses (either the IPv4 address "0.0.0.0" or the IPv6 address "::").
