# Data Source: elasticstack_elasticsearch_ingest_processor_date_index_name

The purpose of this processor is to point documents to the right time based index based on a date or timestamp field in a document by using the date math index name support.

The processor sets the _index metadata field with a date math index name expression based on the provided index name prefix, a date or timestamp field in the documents being processed and the provided date rounding.

First, this processor fetches the date or timestamp from a field in the document being processed. Optionally, date formatting can be configured on how the fieldâ€™s value should be parsed into a date. Then this date, the provided index name prefix and the provided date rounding get formatted into a date math index name expression. Also here optionally date formatting can be specified on how the date should be formatted into a date math index name expression.
