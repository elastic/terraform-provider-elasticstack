# Data Source: elasticstack_elasticsearch_ingest_processor_grok

Extracts structured fields out of a single text field within a document. You choose which field to extract matched fields from, as well as the grok pattern you expect will match. A grok pattern is like a regular expression that supports aliased expressions that can be reused.

This processor comes packaged with many [reusable patterns](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/blob/master/libs/grok/src/main/resources/patterns).

If you need help building patterns to match your logs, you will find the [Grok Debugger](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/kibana/master/xpack-grokdebugger.html) tool quite useful! [The Grok Constructor](https://grokconstructor.appspot.com/) is also a useful tool.
