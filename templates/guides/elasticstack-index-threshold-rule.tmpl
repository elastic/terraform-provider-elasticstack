# Managing Kibana connector and rule resources

You can use rules to detect complex conditions and generate alerts and actions when those conditions are met.

For example, let's take a simple data stream that contains some logs or metrics:

{{ tffile "examples/resources/elasticstack_elasticsearch_data_stream/resource-index-rule.tf" }}

You can define an index threshold rule to detect when your data stream exceeds a threshold.
In this simple example, the rule checks whether the count of all documents in the data stream exceeds 10 over a period of 1 day:

{{ tffile "examples/resources/elasticstack_kibana_alerting_rule/resource-index-rule.tf" }}

NOTE: When you've finished playing with this example, remember to destroy the rule resource, since it has a low threshold and generates a lot of documents for testing purposes.

There are many different methods that you can use to be notified when the threshold is met and when it recovers.
In this example, the rule uses an index connector to write a document in an Elasticsearch index when the rule conditions are met:

{{ tffile "examples/resources/elasticstack_kibana_action_connector/resource-index-connector.tf" }}

The `executionTimeField` is optional; in this case we set it so that each document will contain a timestamp that indicates when the alert occurred.
For example, the index connector can generate documents in a simple index like this:

{{ tffile "examples/resources/elasticstack_elasticsearch_index/resource-index-rule.tf" }}

After you apply these resources, add some documents to the data stream:
https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/use-a-data-stream.html#add-documents-to-a-data-stream

For example:

````
PUT my-data-stream/_bulk
{ "create":{ } }
{ "@timestamp": "2023-07-04T16:21:15.000Z", "field1": "host1", "field2": "test message" }
{ "create":{ } }
{ "@timestamp": "2023-07-04T16:25:42.000Z", "field1": "host2", "field2": "test message" }

````

When the rule conditions are met, you'll start to see documents added to `my-index`.
