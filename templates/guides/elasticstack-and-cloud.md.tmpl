# Using the Elastic Stack provider with Elastic Cloud

A common scenario for using the Elastic Stack provider, is to manage & configure Elastic Cloud deployments.
In order to do that, we'll use both the Elastic Cloud provider, as well as the Elastic Stack provider.
Start off by configuring just the Elastic Cloud provider in a `provider.tf` file for example:

{{ tffile "examples/cloud/provider.tf" }}

Notice that the Elastic Stack  provider setup with empty `elasticsearch {}` block, since we'll be using an `elasticsearch_connection` block
for each of our resources, to point to the Elastic Cloud deployment.

Next, we'll set up an Elastic Cloud `ec_deployment` resource, which represents an Elastic Stack deployment on Elastic Cloud.
We shall configure the deployment using the credentials that it outputs once created

{{ tffile "examples/cloud/deployment.tf" }}
