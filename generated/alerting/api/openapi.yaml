        To create a rule, you must have `all` privileges for the appropriate Kibana features, depending on the `consumer` and `rule_type_id` of the rule you're creating. For example, you must have privileges for the **Management > Stack rules** feature, **Analytics > Discover** and **Machine Learning** features, **Observability** features, or **Security** features. If the rule has actions, you must also have `read` privileges for the **Management > Actions and Connectors** feature. This API supports both key- and token-based authentication. To use key-based authentication, create an API key in Kibana and use it in the header of the API call. To use token-based authentication, provide a username and password; an API key that matches the current privileges of the user is created automatically. In both cases, the API key is subsequently used for authorization when the rule runs.

        To update a rule, you must have `all` privileges for the appropriate Kibana features, depending on the `consumer` and `rule_type_id` of the rule you're updating. For example, you must have privileges for the **Management > Stack rules** feature, **Analytics > Discover** and **Machine Learning** features, **Observability** features, or **Security** features. If the rule has actions, you must also have `read` privileges for the **Management > Actions and Connectors** feature. This API supports both key- and token-based authentication.

NOTE: If the API key has different privileges than the key that created or most recently updated the rule, the rule behavior might change. Though some properties are optional, when you update the rule the existing property values are overwritten with default values. Therefore, it is recommended to explicitly set all property values.

NOTE: You cannot specify the throttle interval at both the rule and action level. The recommended method is to set it for each action. If you set it at the rule level then update the rule in Kibana, it is automatically changed to use action-specific values.
