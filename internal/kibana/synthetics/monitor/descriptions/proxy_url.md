The URL of the SOCKS5 proxy to use when connecting to the server. The value must be a URL with a scheme of `socks5://`. If the SOCKS5 proxy server requires client authentication, then a username and password can be embedded in the URL. When using a proxy, hostnames are resolved on the proxy server instead of on the client. You can change this behavior by setting the `proxy_use_local_resolver` option.
