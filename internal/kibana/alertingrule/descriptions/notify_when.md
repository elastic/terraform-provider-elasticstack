Required until v8.6.0. Deprecated in v8.13.0. Use the `notify_when` property in the action `frequency` object instead. Defines how often alerts generate actions. Valid values include: `onActionGroupChange`: Actions run when the alert status changes; `onActiveAlert`: Actions run when the alert becomes active and at each check interval while the rule conditions are met; `onThrottleInterval`: Actions run when the alert becomes active and at the interval specified in the throttle property while the rule conditions are met. NOTE: This is a rule level property; if you update the rule in Kibana, it is automatically changed to use action-specific `notify_when` values.
