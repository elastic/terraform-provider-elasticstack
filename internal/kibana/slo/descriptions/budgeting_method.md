An `occurrences` budgeting method uses the number of good and total events during the time window. A `timeslices` budgeting method uses the number of good slices and total slices during the time window. A slice is an arbitrary time window (smaller than the overall SLO time window) that is either considered good or bad, calculated from the timeslice threshold and the ratio of good over total events that happened during the slice window. A budgeting method is required and must be either occurrences or timeslices.
