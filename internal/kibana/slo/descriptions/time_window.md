Currently support `calendarAligned` and `rolling` time windows. Any duration greater than 1 day can be used: days, weeks, months, quarters, years. Rolling time window requires a duration, e.g. `1w` for one week, and type: `rolling`. SLOs defined with such time window, will only consider the SLI data from the last duration period as a moving window. Calendar aligned time window requires a duration, limited to `1M` for monthly or `1w` for weekly, and type: `calendarAligned`.
