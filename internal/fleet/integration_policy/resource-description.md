Creates or updates a Fleet Integration Policy.

The [Kibana Fleet UI](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/fleet/current/add-integration-to-policy.html)
can be used as a reference for what data needs to be provided. Instead of saving
a new integration configuration, the API request can be previewed, showing what
values need to be provided for inputs and their streams.
