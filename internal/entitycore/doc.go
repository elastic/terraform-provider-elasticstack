// Package entitycore provides a shared embedded core for Plugin Framework entities:
// [ResourceBase] centralizes [resource.ResourceWithConfigure] Configure wiring, the Metadata method
// required by [resource.Resource], and stores the configured [*clients.ProviderClientFactory]
// for use via [ResourceBase.Client]. Data sources are covered by [DataSourceBase].
//
// Component is a typed Terraform resource type-name namespace segment (for example
// "elasticsearch", "kibana"). It is not a client-resolution kind: the same API family
// can use different component strings for Terraform naming, such as APM resources
// using the "apm" segment while calling Kibana APIs.
//
// The resourceName argument to [NewResourceBase] is the final literal suffix segment in the
// Terraform type name, joined without normalization. Callers must preserve existing
// spellings for compatibility (for example "agentbuilder_tool" versus "agent_builder_tool").
