Processors to run immediately after a processor failure. Each processor supports a processor-level `on_failure` value. If a processor without an `on_failure` value fails, Elasticsearch uses this pipeline-level parameter as a fallback. The processors in this parameter run sequentially in the order specified. Elasticsearch will not attempt to run the pipeline’s remaining processors. See: https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/processors.html. Each record must be a valid JSON document
