Manages Elasticsearch transforms. See the [transforms documentation](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/transforms.html) for more details.

**NOTE:** Some transform settings require a minimum Elasticsearch version. Such settings will be ignored when applied to versions below the required one (a warning will be issued in the logs).
