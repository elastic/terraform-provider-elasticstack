Specifies whether the datafeed checks for missing data and the size of the window. The datafeed can optionally search over indices that have already been read in an effort to determine whether any data has subsequently been added to the index. If missing data is found, it is a good indication that the `query_delay` is set too low and the data is being indexed after the datafeed has passed that moment in time. This check runs only on real-time datafeeds.
