The number of seconds behind real time that data is queried. For example, if data from 10:04 a.m. might not be searchable in Elasticsearch until 10:06 a.m., set this property to 120 seconds. The default value is randomly selected between `60s` and `120s`. This randomness improves the query performance when there are multiple jobs running on the same node.
