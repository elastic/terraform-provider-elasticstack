If a real-time datafeed has never seen any data (including during any initial training period), it automatically stops and closes the associated job after this many real-time searches return no documents. In other words, it stops after `frequency` times `max_empty_searches` of real-time operation. If not set, a datafeed with no end time that sees no data remains started until it is explicitly stopped.
