# Contributing

This guide explains how to set up your environment, make changes, and submit a PR.

## Development Setup

* Fork and clone the repo.
* Setup your preferred IDE (IntelliJ, VSCode, etc.)

Requirements:
* [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html) >= 1.0.0
* [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install) >= 1.25
* Docker (for acceptance tests)

## Development Workflow

* Create a new branch for your changes.
* Make your changes. See [Useful Commands](#useful-commands) and [Debugging](#running--debugging-the-provider).
* Validate your changes
  * Run unit and acceptance tests (See [Running Acceptance Tests](#running-acceptance-tests)).
  * Run `make lint` to check linting and formatting. For this check to succeed, all changes must have been committed.
  * All checks also run automatically on every PR.
* Submit your PR for review.
* Add a changelog entry in `CHANGELOG.md` under the `Unreleased` section. This will be included in the release notes of the next release. The changelog entry references the PR, so it has to be added after the PR has been opened.

When creating new resources:
* Use the [Plugin Framework](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/plugin/framework/getting-started/code-walkthrough) for new resources.
  * Use an existing resource (e.g. `internal/elasticsearch/security/system_user`) as a template.
  * Some resources use the deprecated Terraform SDK, so only resources using the new Terraform Framework should be used as reference.
* Use the generated API clients to interact with the Kibana APIs. (See [Working with Generated API Clients](#working-with-generated-api-clients)
* Add a documentation template and examples for the resource. See [Updating Documentation](#updating-documentation) for more details.
* Write unit and acceptance tests.

### Useful Commands

* `make build`: Build the provider.
* `make lint`: Lints and formats the code.
* `make test`: Run unit tests.
* `make docs-generate`: Generate documentation.
* [Running & Debugging the Provider](#running--debugging-the-provider)
* [Running Acceptance Tests](#running-acceptance-tests)

### Running & Debugging the Provider

You can run the currently checked-out code for local testing and use it with Terraform.

Also see [Terraform docs on debugging](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/plugin/debugging#starting-a-provider-in-debug-mode).

Run the provider in debug mode and reattach the provider in Terraform:
* Launch `main.go` with the `-debug` flag from your IDE.
  * Or launch it with `go run main.go -debug` from the command line.
* After launching, the provider will print an env var. Copy the printed `TF_REATTACH_PROVIDERS='{…}'` value.
* Export it in your shell where you run Terraform: `export TF_REATTACH_PROVIDERS='{…}'`.
* Terraform will now talk to your debug instance, and you can set breakpoints.

### Running Acceptance Tests

Acceptance tests spin up Elasticsearch, Kibana, and Fleet with Docker and run tests in a Go container.

```bash
# Start Elasticsearch, Kibana, and Fleet
make docker-fleet

# Run all tests
make testacc

# Run a specific test
make testacc TESTARGS='-run ^TestAccResourceDataStreamLifecycle$$'

# Cleanup created docker containers
make docker-clean
```

### Working with Generated API Clients

If your work involves the Kibana API, the API client can be generated directly from the Kibana OpenAPI specs:
- For Kibana APIs, use the generated client in `generated/kbapi`.
- To add new endpoints, see [generated/kbapi/README.md](generated/kbapi/README.md).
- Regenerate clients with:
  ```sh
  make transform generate
  ```

The codebase includes a number of deprecated clients which should not be used anymore:
- `libs/go-kibana-rest`: Fork of an external library, which is not maintained anymore.
- `generated/alerting`, `generated/connectors`, `generated/slo`: Older generated clients, but based on non-standard specs. If any of these APIs are needed, they should be included in the `kbapi` client.

### Updating Documentation

Docs are generated from templates in `templates/` and examples in `examples/`.
* Update or add templates and examples.
* Run `make docs-generate` to produce files under `docs/`.
* Commit the generated files. `make lint` will fail if docs are stale.

## Releasing (maintainers)

Releasing is implemented in CI pipeline.

To release a new provider version:

* Create PR which
- updates Makefile with the new provider VERSION (e.g. `VERSION ?= 0.11.13`);
- updates CHANGELOG.md with the list of changes being released.
[Example](https://github.com/elastic/terraform-provider-elasticstack/commit/be866ebc918184e843dc1dd2f6e2e1b963da386d).

* Once the PR is merged, the release CI pipeline can be started by pushing a new release tag to the `main` branch. (`git tag v0.11.13 && git push origin v0.11.13`)
