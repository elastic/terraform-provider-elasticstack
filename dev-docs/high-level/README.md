# High-level developer docs

These pages are the “starting point” docs for contributors and code-review automation.
They intentionally stay high-level and link to deeper, canonical docs elsewhere in the repo.

- Workflow: [`development-workflow.md`](./development-workflow.md)
- Testing: [`testing.md`](./testing.md)
- Generated clients: [`generated-clients.md`](./generated-clients.md)
- Documentation: [`documentation.md`](./documentation.md)
