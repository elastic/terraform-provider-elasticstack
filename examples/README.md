# Examples

This example section includes examples for using the provider both on self-managed elasticsearch cluster, as well as in conjunction with a managed [Elastic Cloud](https://cloud.elastic.co) deployment.

Using the provider in conjunction with the [Elastic Cloud terraform provider](https://github.com/elastic/terraform-provider-ec), allows users to spin up and configure an Elastic Stack in a single ```terraform apply``` command, allowing for great end-to-end use cases of spinning up preconfigured clusters for any use case or need.
