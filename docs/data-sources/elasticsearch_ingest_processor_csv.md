# Data Source: elasticstack_elasticsearch_ingest_processor_csv

Helper data source to which can be used to extract fields from CSV line out of a single text field within a document. Any empty field in CSV will be skipped.

See: https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/csv-processor.html

## Example Usage

```terraform
provider "elasticstack" {
  elasticsearch {}
}

data "elasticstack_elasticsearch_ingest_processor_csv" "csv" {
  field         = "my_field"
  target_fields = ["field1", "field2"]
}

resource "elasticstack_elasticsearch_ingest_pipeline" "my_ingest_pipeline" {
  name = "csv-ingest"

  processors = [
    data.elasticstack_elasticsearch_ingest_processor_csv.csv.json
  ]
}
```

If the `trim` option is enabled then any whitespace in the beginning and in the end of each unquoted field will be trimmed. For example with configuration above, a value of A, B will result in field field2 having value {nbsp}B (with space at the beginning). If trim is enabled A, B will result in field field2 having value B (no whitespace). Quoted fields will be left untouched.
