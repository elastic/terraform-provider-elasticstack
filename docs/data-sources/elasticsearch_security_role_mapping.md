### Required

- `name` (String) The distinct name that identifies the role mapping, used solely as an identifier.

### Optional

- `elasticsearch_connection` (Block List, Max: 1, Deprecated) Elasticsearch connection configuration block. This property will be removed in a future provider version. Configure the Elasticsearch connection via the provider configuration instead. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--elasticsearch_connection))

### Read-Only

- `enabled` (Boolean) Mappings that have `enabled` set to `false` are ignored when role mapping is performed.
- `id` (String) Internal identifier of the resource
- `metadata` (String) Additional metadata that helps define which roles are assigned to each user. Keys beginning with `_` are reserved for system usage.
- `role_templates` (String) A list of mustache templates that will be evaluated to determine the roles names that should granted to the users that match the role mapping rules.
- `roles` (Set of String) A list of role names that are granted to the users that match the role mapping rules.
- `rules` (String) The rules that determine which users should be matched by the mapping. A rule is a logical condition that is expressed by using a JSON DSL.
