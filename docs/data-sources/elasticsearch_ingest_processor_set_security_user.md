# Data Source: elasticstack_elasticsearch_ingest_processor_set_security_user

Sets user-related details (such as `username`, `roles`, `email`, `full_name`, `metadata`, `api_key`, `realm` and `authentication_typ`e) from the current authenticated user to the current document by pre-processing the ingest. The `api_key` property exists only if the user authenticates with an API key. It is an object containing the id, name and metadata (if it exists and is non-empty) fields of the API key. The realm property is also an object with two fields, name and type. When using API key authentication, the realm property refers to the realm from which the API key is created. The `authentication_type property` is a string that can take value from `REALM`, `API_KEY`, `TOKEN` and `ANONYMOUS`.
