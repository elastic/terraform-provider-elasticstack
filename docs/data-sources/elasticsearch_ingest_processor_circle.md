# Data Source: elasticstack_elasticsearch_ingest_processor_circle

Helper data source to which can be used to create a processor to convert circle definitions of shapes to regular polygons which approximate them.

See: https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/ingest-circle-processor.html

## Example Usage

```terraform
provider "elasticstack" {
  elasticsearch {}
}

data "elasticstack_elasticsearch_ingest_processor_circle" "circle" {
  field          = "circle"
  error_distance = 28.1
  shape_type     = "geo_shape"
}

resource "elasticstack_elasticsearch_ingest_pipeline" "my_ingest_pipeline" {
  name = "circle-ingest"

  processors = [
    data.elasticstack_elasticsearch_ingest_processor_circle.circle.json
  ]
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `error_distance` (Number) The difference between the resulting inscribed distance from center to side and the circleâ€™s radius (measured in meters for `geo_shape`, unit-less for `shape`)
- `field` (String) The string-valued field to trim whitespace from.
- `shape_type` (String) Which field mapping type is to be used when processing the circle.

### Optional

- `description` (String) Description of the processor.
- `if` (String) Conditionally execute the processor
- `ignore_failure` (Boolean) Ignore failures for the processor.
- `ignore_missing` (Boolean) If `true` and `field` does not exist or is `null`, the processor quietly exits without modifying the document.
- `on_failure` (List of String) Handle failures for the processor.
- `tag` (String) Identifier for the processor.
- `target_field` (String) The field to assign the converted value to, by default `field` is updated in-place

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) Internal identifier of the resource
- `json` (String) JSON representation of this data source.
