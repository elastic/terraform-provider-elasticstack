# Data Source: elasticstack_elasticsearch_ingest_processor_user_agent

The `user_agent` processor extracts details from the user agent string a browser sends with its web requests. This processor adds this information by default under the `user_agent` field.

The ingest-user-agent module ships by default with the regexes.yaml made available by uap-java with an Apache 2.0 license. For more details see https://github.com/ua-parser/uap-core.
