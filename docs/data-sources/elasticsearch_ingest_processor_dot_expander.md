  Helper data source to create a processor which expands a field with dots into an object field.

# Data Source: elasticstack_elasticsearch_ingest_processor_dot_expander

Expands a field with dots into an object field. This processor allows fields with dots in the name to be accessible by other processors in the pipeline. Otherwise these fields canâ€™t be accessed by any processor.

See: elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/dot-expand-processor.html


## Example Usage

```terraform
provider "elasticstack" {
  elasticsearch {}
}

data "elasticstack_elasticsearch_ingest_processor_dot_expander" "dot_expander" {
  field = "foo.bar"
}

resource "elasticstack_elasticsearch_ingest_pipeline" "my_ingest_pipeline" {
  name = "dot-expander-ingest"

  processors = [
    data.elasticstack_elasticsearch_ingest_processor_dot_expander.dot_expander.json
  ]
}
```
