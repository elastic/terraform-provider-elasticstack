# elasticstack_elasticsearch_ingest_processor_registered_domain (Data Source)

Helper data source which can be used to create the configuration for a registered domain processor. This processor extracts the registered domain (also known as the effective top-level domain or eTLD), sub-domain, and top-level domain from a fully qualified domain name (FQDN). See: https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/registered-domain-processor.html

## Example Usage

```terraform
provider "elasticstack" {
  elasticsearch {}
}

data "elasticstack_elasticsearch_ingest_processor_registered_domain" "domain" {
  field        = "fqdn"
  target_field = "url"
}

resource "elasticstack_elasticsearch_ingest_pipeline" "my_ingest_pipeline" {
  name = "domain-ingest"

  processors = [
    data.elasticstack_elasticsearch_ingest_processor_registered_domain.domain.json
  ]
}
```
