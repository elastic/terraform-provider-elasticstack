# Data Source: elasticstack_elasticsearch_ingest_processor_date_index_name

The purpose of this processor is to point documents to the right time based index based on a date or timestamp field in a document by using the date math index name support.

The processor sets the _index metadata field with a date math index name expression based on the provided index name prefix, a date or timestamp field in the documents being processed and the provided date rounding.

First, this processor fetches the date or timestamp from a field in the document being processed. Optionally, date formatting can be configured on how the fieldâ€™s value should be parsed into a date. Then this date, the provided index name prefix and the provided date rounding get formatted into a date math index name expression. Also here optionally date formatting can be specified on how the date should be formatted into a date math index name expression.

See: https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/date-index-name-processor.html

## Example Usage

```terraform
provider "elasticstack" {
  elasticsearch {}
}

data "elasticstack_elasticsearch_ingest_processor_date_index_name" "date_index_name" {
  description       = "monthly date-time index naming"
  field             = "date1"
  index_name_prefix = "my-index-"
  date_rounding     = "M"
}

resource "elasticstack_elasticsearch_ingest_pipeline" "my_ingest_pipeline" {
  name = "date-index-name-ingest"

  processors = [
    data.elasticstack_elasticsearch_ingest_processor_date_index_name.date_index_name.json
  ]
}
```
