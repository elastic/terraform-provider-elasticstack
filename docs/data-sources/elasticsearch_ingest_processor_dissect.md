# Data Source: elasticstack_elasticsearch_ingest_processor_dissect

Similar to the Grok Processor, dissect also extracts structured fields out of a single text field within a document. However unlike the Grok Processor, dissect does not use Regular Expressions. This allows dissect’s syntax to be simple and for some cases faster than the Grok Processor.

Dissect matches a single text field against a defined pattern.


See: https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/dissect-processor.html

## Example Usage

```terraform
provider "elasticstack" {
  elasticsearch {}
}

data "elasticstack_elasticsearch_ingest_processor_dissect" "dissect" {
  field   = "message"
  pattern = "%%{clientip} %%{ident} %%{auth} [%%{@timestamp}] \"%%{verb} %%{request} HTTP/%%{httpversion}\" %%{status} %%{size}"
}

resource "elasticstack_elasticsearch_ingest_pipeline" "my_ingest_pipeline" {
  name = "dissect-ingest"

  processors = [
    data.elasticstack_elasticsearch_ingest_processor_dissect.dissect.json
  ]
}
```
