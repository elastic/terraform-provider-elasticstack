  How It Works
  This resource creates or updates a component template named <index_template>@custom with the index.lifecycle.name setting.
  Fleet-managed index templates typically include <template>@custom in their composed_of list. When this component template exists, its settings are merged into the index template.
  Key behaviors:
  Non-destructive: If the @custom component template already exists with other settings, this resource preserves them and only adds/updates the ILM setting.Clean deletion: When destroyed, this resource removes only the index.lifecycle.name setting. If other settings exist in the @custom template, they are preserved. If the template becomes empty, it is deleted.
  Limitations:
  Version field not updated: This resource does not modify the component template's version field. If you rely on version tracking for change detection (e.g., external tooling that monitors template versions), consider using elasticstack_elasticsearch_component_template instead, which gives you full control over the template including its version.
  When to Use This Resource
  Use this resource when:
  You want to attach an ILM policy to a Fleet-managed index templateYou want to attach an ILM policy to an externally-managed index template that includes <template>@custom in its composed_of listYou don't want Terraform to manage the entire index template
  Do NOT use this resource when:

  | `elasticstack_elasticsearch_component_template` | Entire `@custom` template | Overwrites any external changes to the template |
  | `elasticstack_elasticsearch_index_template_ilm_attachment` | Only the ILM setting | Preserves other settings in the template |

# elasticstack_elasticsearch_index_template_ilm_attachment (Resource)

Attaches an ILM policy to a Fleet-managed or externally-managed index template by creating/updating the `@custom` component template with the lifecycle setting.

**Important:** Do NOT use this resource for index templates already managed by Terraform. Instead, set `index.lifecycle.name` directly in the `elasticstack_elasticsearch_index_template` or `elasticstack_elasticsearch_component_template` resource settings.

See the [official Elastic documentation](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/fleet/current/data-streams-scenario3.html) for more information about customizing Fleet-managed data streams.

## How It Works

This resource creates or updates a component template named `<index_template>@custom` with the `index.lifecycle.name` setting.

Fleet-managed index templates typically include `<template>@custom` in their `composed_of` list. When this component template exists, its settings are merged into the index template.

**Key behaviors:**

- **Non-destructive**: If the `@custom` component template already exists with other settings, this resource preserves them and only adds/updates the ILM setting.
- **Clean deletion**: When destroyed, this resource removes only the `index.lifecycle.name` setting. If other settings exist in the `@custom` template, they are preserved. If the template becomes empty, it is deleted.

**Limitations:**

- **Version field not updated**: This resource does not modify the component template's `version` field. If you rely on version tracking for change detection (e.g., external tooling that monitors template versions), consider using `elasticstack_elasticsearch_component_template` instead, which gives you full control over the template including its version.

## When to Use This Resource

Use this resource when:

- You want to attach an ILM policy to a Fleet-managed index template
- You want to attach an ILM policy to an externally-managed index template that includes `<template>@custom` in its `composed_of` list
- You don't want Terraform to manage the entire index template

Do NOT use this resource when:

- The index template is already managed by `elasticstack_elasticsearch_index_template` — set `index.lifecycle.name` directly in the template's settings instead
- The `@custom` component template is already managed by `elasticstack_elasticsearch_component_template` — set the ILM setting there instead

## Alternative Approach

You can achieve similar results using `elasticstack_elasticsearch_component_template` directly. **Comparison:**

| Approach | Terraform Manages | Behavior |
|----------|-------------------|----------|
| `elasticstack_elasticsearch_component_template` | Entire `@custom` template | Overwrites any external changes to the template |
| `elasticstack_elasticsearch_index_template_ilm_attachment` | Only the ILM setting | Preserves other settings in the template |

Use `elasticstack_elasticsearch_component_template` if you want full control over the `@custom` template. Use this resource if you only want to manage the ILM setting and preserve any other customizations.

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Create an ILM policy
resource "elasticstack_elasticsearch_index_lifecycle" "retention_90d" {
  name = "90-days-retention"

  hot {
    rollover {
      max_age = "7d"
    }
  }

  delete {
    min_age = "90d"
    delete {}
  }
}

# Attach the ILM policy to a Fleet-managed template
resource "elasticstack_elasticsearch_index_template_ilm_attachment" "logs_system" {
  index_template = "logs-system.syslog"
  lifecycle_name = elasticstack_elasticsearch_index_lifecycle.retention_90d.name
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `index_template` (String) Name of the index template to attach the ILM policy to. For Fleet-managed templates, this is typically the template name (e.g., 'logs-system.syslog').
- `lifecycle_name` (String) Name of the ILM policy to attach to the index template.

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) Internal identifier of the resource.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

The [`terraform import` command](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/import) can be used, for example:

```shell
terraform import elasticstack_elasticsearch_index_template_ilm_attachment.logs_system <cluster_uuid>/logs-system.syslog@custom
```
