# Resource: elasticstack_elasticsearch_index_lifecycle

Creates or updates lifecycle policy. See: https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/ilm-put-lifecycle.html and https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/ilm-index-lifecycle.html

## Example Usage

```terraform
provider "elasticstack" {
  elasticsearch {}
}

resource "elasticstack_elasticsearch_index_lifecycle" "my_ilm" {
  name = "my_ilm_policy"

  hot {
    min_age = "1h"
    set_priority {
      priority = 0
    }
    rollover {
      max_age = "1d"
    }
    readonly {}
  }

  warm {
    min_age = "0ms"
    set_priority {
      priority = 10
    }
    readonly {}
    allocate {
      exclude = jsonencode({
        box_type = "hot"
      })
      number_of_replicas    = 1
      total_shards_per_node = 200
    }
  }

  delete {
    min_age = "2d"
    delete {}
  }
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `name` (String) Identifier for the policy.

### Optional

- `cold` (Block List, Max: 1) The index is no longer being updated and is queried infrequently. The information still needs to be searchable, but it’s okay if those queries are slower. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--cold))
- `delete` (Block List, Max: 1) The index is no longer needed and can safely be removed. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--delete))
- `elasticsearch_connection` (Block List, Max: 1, Deprecated) Elasticsearch connection configuration block. This property will be removed in a future provider version. Configure the Elasticsearch connection via the provider configuration instead. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--elasticsearch_connection))
- `frozen` (Block List, Max: 1) The index is no longer being updated and is queried rarely. The information still needs to be searchable, but it’s okay if those queries are extremely slow. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--frozen))
- `hot` (Block List, Max: 1) The index is actively being updated and queried. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--hot))
- `metadata` (String) Optional user metadata about the ilm policy. Must be valid JSON document.
- `warm` (Block List, Max: 1) The index is no longer being updated but is still being queried. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--warm))

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) Internal identifier of the resource
- `modified_date` (String) The DateTime of the last modification.

<a id="nestedblock--cold"></a>
### Nested Schema for `cold`

Optional:

- `allocate` (Block List, Max: 1) Updates the index settings to change which nodes are allowed to host the index shards and change the number of replicas. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--cold--allocate))
- `downsample` (Block List, Max: 1) Roll up documents within a fixed interval to a single summary document. Reduces the index footprint by storing time series data at reduced granularity. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--cold--downsample))
- `freeze` (Block List, Max: 1) Freeze the index to minimize its memory footprint. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--cold--freeze))

- `min_age` (String) ILM moves indices through the lifecycle according to their age. To control the timing of these transitions, you set a minimum age for each phase.
- `readonly` (Block List, Max: 1) Makes the index read-only. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--cold--readonly))
- `searchable_snapshot` (Block List, Max: 1) Takes a snapshot of the managed index in the configured repository and mounts it as a searchable snapshot. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--cold--searchable_snapshot))
- `set_priority` (Block List, Max: 1) Sets a source index to read-only and shrinks it into a new index with fewer primary shards. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--cold--set_priority))
- `unfollow` (Block List, Max: 1) Convert a follower index to a regular index. Performed automatically before a rollover, shrink, or searchable snapshot action. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--cold--unfollow))
