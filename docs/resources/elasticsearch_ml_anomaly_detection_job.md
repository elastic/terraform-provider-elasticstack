### Read-Only

- `create_time` (String) The time the job was created.
- `id` (String) Internal identifier of the resource
- `job_type` (String) Reserved for future use, currently set to anomaly_detector.

### Nested Schema for `analysis_config`

Required:

- `bucket_span` (String) The size of the interval that the analysis is aggregated into, typically between 15m and 1h. If the anomaly detector is expecting to see data at near real-time frequency, then the bucket_span should be set to a value around 10 times the time between ingested documents. For example, if data comes every second, bucket_span should be 10s; if data comes every 5 minutes, bucket_span should be 50m. For sparse or batch data, use larger bucket_span values.
- `detectors` (Attributes List) Detector configuration objects. Detectors identify the anomaly detection functions and the fields on which they operate. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--analysis_config--detectors))

Optional:

- `categorization_field_name` (String) For categorization jobs only. The name of the field to categorize.
- `categorization_filters` (List of String) For categorization jobs only. An array of regular expressions. A categorization message is matched against each regex in the order they are listed in the array.
- `influencers` (List of String) A comma separated list of influencer field names. Typically these can be the by, over, or partition fields that are used in the detector configuration.
- `latency` (String) The size of the window in which to expect data that is out of time order. If you specify a non-zero value, it must be greater than or equal to one second.
- `model_prune_window` (String) Advanced configuration option. The time interval (in days) between pruning the model.
- `multivariate_by_fields` (Boolean) This functionality is reserved for internal use. It is not supported for use in customer environments and is not subject to the support SLA of official GA features.
- `per_partition_categorization` (Attributes) Settings related to how categorization interacts with partition fields. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--analysis_config--per_partition_categorization))
- `summary_count_field_name` (String) If this property is specified, the data that is fed to the job is expected to be pre-summarized.
