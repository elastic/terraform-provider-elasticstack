Adds and updates roles in the native realm. See, https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/security-api-put-role.html

## Example Usage

```terraform
provider "elasticstack" {
  elasticsearch {}
}

resource "elasticstack_elasticsearch_security_role" "role" {
  name    = "testrole"
  cluster = ["all"]

  indices {
    names      = ["index1", "index2"]
    privileges = ["all"]
  }

  applications {
    application = "myapp"
    privileges  = ["admin", "read"]
    resources   = ["*"]
  }

  run_as = ["other_user"]

  metadata = jsonencode({
    version = 1
  })
}

output "role" {
  value = elasticstack_elasticsearch_security_role.role

## Schema

### Required

- `name` (String) The name of the role.

### Optional

- `applications` (Block Set) A list of application privilege entries. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--applications))
- `cluster` (Set of String) A list of cluster privileges. These privileges define the cluster level actions that users with this role are able to execute.
- `elasticsearch_connection` (Block List, Max: 1) Elasticsearch connection configuration block. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--elasticsearch_connection))
- `global` (String) An object defining global privileges.
- `indices` (Block Set) A list of indices permissions entries. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--indices))
- `metadata` (String) Optional meta-data.
- `run_as` (Set of String) A list of users that the owners of this role can impersonate.

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) Internal identifier of the resource

<a id="nestedblock--applications"></a>
### Nested Schema for `applications`

Required:

- `application` (String) The name of the application to which this entry applies.
- `privileges` (Set of String) A list of strings, where each element is the name of an application privilege or action.
- `resources` (Set of String) A list resources to which the privileges are applied.


<a id="nestedblock--elasticsearch_connection"></a>
### Nested Schema for `elasticsearch_connection`

Optional:

- `api_key` (String, Sensitive) API Key to use for authentication to Elasticsearch
- `ca_data` (String) PEM-encoded custom Certificate Authority certificate
- `ca_file` (String) Path to a custom Certificate Authority certificate
- `cert_data` (String) PEM encoded certificate for client auth
- `cert_file` (String) Path to a file containing the PEM encoded certificate for client auth
- `endpoints` (List of String, Sensitive) A comma-separated list of endpoints where the terraform provider will point to, this must include the http(s) schema and port number.
- `insecure` (Boolean) Disable TLS certificate validation
- `key_data` (String, Sensitive) PEM encoded private key for client auth

- `password` (String, Sensitive) Password to use for API authentication to Elasticsearch.
- `username` (String) Username to use for API authentication to Elasticsearch.


<a id="nestedblock--indices"></a>
### Nested Schema for `indices`

Required:

- `names` (Set of String) A list of indices (or index name patterns) to which the permissions in this entry apply.
- `privileges` (Set of String) The index level privileges that the owners of the role have on the specified indices.

Optional:

- `allow_restricted_indices` (Boolean) Include matching restricted indices in names parameter. Usage is strongly discouraged as it can grant unrestricted operations on critical data, make the entire system unstable or leak sensitive information.
- `field_security` (Block List, Max: 1) The document fields that the owners of the role have read access to. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--indices--field_security))
- `query` (String) A search query that defines the documents the owners of the role have read access to.

<a id="nestedblock--indices--field_security"></a>
### Nested Schema for `indices.field_security`
