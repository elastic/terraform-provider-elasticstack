# Resource: elasticstack_fleet_integration

Installs or uninstalls a Fleet integration package. The Kibana Fleet UI can be
used to view available packages. Additional information for managing integration
packages can be found [here](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/fleet/current/install-uninstall-integration-assets.html).

To prevent the package from being uninstalled when the resource is destroyed,
set `skip_destroy` to `true`.

## Example Usage

```terraform
provider "elasticstack" {
  kibana {}
}

resource "elasticstack_fleet_integration" "test_integration" {
  name    = "tcp"
  version = "1.16.0"
  force   = true
}
```
