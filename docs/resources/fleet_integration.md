# elasticstack_fleet_integration (Resource)

Installs or uninstalls a Fleet integration package. The Kibana Fleet UI can be
used to view available packages. Additional information for managing integration
packages can be found [here](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/fleet/current/install-uninstall-integration-assets.html).

To prevent the package from being uninstalled when the resource is destroyed,
set `skip_destroy` to `true`.

## Example Usage

### Basic usage

```terraform
provider "elasticstack" {
  kibana {}
}

resource "elasticstack_fleet_integration" "test_integration" {
  name    = "tcp"
  version = "1.16.0"
  force   = true
}
```

### Tracking the latest version

An integration can track the latest available version by utilizing the `elasticstack_fleet_integration` data source. 
The data source will retrieve the latest available version of the specified integration package, which can then be 
passed to the `version` attribute of the `elasticstack_fleet_integration` resource. 

```terraform
provider "elasticstack" {
  kibana {}
}

data "elasticstack_fleet_integration" "tcp" {
  name = "tcp"
}

resource "elasticstack_fleet_integration" "test_integration" {
  name    = "tcp"
  version = data.elasticstack_fleet_integration.tcp.version
  force   = true
}
```
