# Resource: elasticstack_elasticsearch_snapshot_repository

Registers or updates a snapshot repository. See: https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/put-snapshot-repo-api.html and https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/snapshots-register-repository.html

## Example Usage

```terraform
provider "elasticstack" {
  elasticsearch {}
}

resource "elasticstack_elasticsearch_snapshot_repository" "my_url_repo" {
  name = "my_url_repo"

  url {
    url = "https://example.com/repo"
  }
}

resource "elasticstack_elasticsearch_snapshot_repository" "my_fs_repo" {
  name = "my_fs_repo"

  fs {
    location                  = "/tmp"
    compress                  = true
    max_restore_bytes_per_sec = "10mb"
  }
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `name` (String) Name of the snapshot repository to register or update.

### Optional

- `azure` (Block List, Max: 1) Support for using Azure Blob storage as a repository for Snapshot/Restore. See: https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/plugins/current/repository-azure.html (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--azure))
- `elasticsearch_connection` (Block List, Max: 1, Deprecated) Elasticsearch connection configuration block. This property will be removed in a future provider version. Configure the Elasticsearch connection via the provider configuration instead. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--elasticsearch_connection))
- `fs` (Block List, Max: 1) Shared filesystem repository. Repositories of this type use a shared filesystem to store snapshots. This filesystem must be accessible to all master and data nodes in the cluster. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--fs))
- `gcs` (Block List, Max: 1) Support for using the Google Cloud Storage service as a repository for Snapshot/Restore. See: https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/plugins/current/repository-gcs.html (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--gcs))
- `hdfs` (Block List, Max: 1) Support for using HDFS File System as a repository for Snapshot/Restore. See: https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/plugins/current/repository-hdfs.html (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--hdfs))
- `s3` (Block List, Max: 1) Support for using AWS S3 as a repository for Snapshot/Restore. See: https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/plugins/current/repository-s3-repository.html (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--s3))
- `url` (Block List, Max: 1) URL repository. Repositories of this type are read-only for the cluster. This means the cluster can retrieve or restore snapshots from the repository but cannot write or create snapshots in it. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--url))
- `verify` (Boolean) If true, the request verifies the repository is functional on all master and data nodes in the cluster.
