# Resource: elasticstack_elasticsearch_snapshot_lifecycle

Creates or updates a snapshot lifecycle policy. See, https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/slm-api-put-policy.html

## Example Usage

```terraform
provider "elasticstack" {
  elasticsearch {}
}

// create a repository for snapshots
resource "elasticstack_elasticsearch_snapshot_repository" "repo" {
  name = "my_snap_repo"

  fs {
    location                  = "/tmp/snapshots"
    compress                  = true
    max_restore_bytes_per_sec = "20mb"
  }
}

// create a SLM policy and use the above created repository
resource "elasticstack_elasticsearch_snapshot_lifecycle" "slm_policy" {
  name = "my_slm_policy"

  schedule      = "0 30 1 * * ?"
  snapshot_name = "<daily-snap-{now/d}>"
  repository    = elasticstack_elasticsearch_snapshot_repository.repo.name

  indices              = ["data-*", "important"]
  ignore_unavailable   = false
  include_global_state = false

  expire_after = "30d"
  min_count    = 5
  max_count    = 50
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `name` (String) ID for the snapshot lifecycle policy you want to create or update.
- `repository` (String) Repository used to store snapshots created by this policy.
- `schedule` (String) Periodic or absolute schedule at which the policy creates snapshots.

### Optional

- `elasticsearch_connection` (Block List, Max: 1) Elasticsearch connection configuration block. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--elasticsearch_connection))
- `expand_wildcards` (String) Determines how wildcard patterns in the `indices` parameter match data streams and indices. Supports comma-separated values, such as `closed,hidden`.
- `expire_after` (String) Time period after which a snapshot is considered expired and eligible for deletion.
- `feature_states` (Set of String) Feature states to include in the snapshot.
- `ignore_unavailable` (Boolean) If `false`, the snapshot fails if any data stream or index in indices is missing or closed. If `true`, the snapshot ignores missing or closed data streams and indices.
- `include_global_state` (Boolean) If `true`, include the cluster state in the snapshot.
- `indices` (Set of String) Comma-separated list of data streams and indices to include in the snapshot.
- `max_count` (Number) Maximum number of snapshots to retain, even if the snapshots have not yet expired.
- `metadata` (String) Attaches arbitrary metadata to the snapshot.
- `min_count` (Number) Minimum number of snapshots to retain, even if the snapshots have expired.
- `partial` (Boolean) If `false`, the entire snapshot will fail if one or more indices included in the snapshot do not have all primary shards available.
- `snapshot_name` (String) Name automatically assigned to each snapshot created by the policy.

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) Internal identifier of the resource

<a id="nestedblock--elasticsearch_connection"></a>
### Nested Schema for `elasticsearch_connection`

Optional:

- `api_key` (String, Sensitive) API Key to use for authentication to Elasticsearch
- `ca_data` (String) PEM-encoded custom Certificate Authority certificate
- `ca_file` (String) Path to a custom Certificate Authority certificate
- `cert_data` (String) PEM encoded certificate for client auth
- `cert_file` (String) Path to a file containing the PEM encoded certificate for client auth
- `endpoints` (List of String, Sensitive) A comma-separated list of endpoints where the terraform provider will point to, this must include the http(s) schema and port number.
- `insecure` (Boolean) Disable TLS certificate validation
- `key_data` (String, Sensitive) PEM encoded private key for client auth
- `key_file` (String) Path to a file containing the PEM encoded private key for client auth
- `password` (String, Sensitive) Password to use for API authentication to Elasticsearch.
- `username` (String) Username to use for API authentication to Elasticsearch.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

```shell
terraform import elasticstack_elasticsearch_snapshot_lifecycle.my_policy <cluster_uuid>/<slm policy name>
