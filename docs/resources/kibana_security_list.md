# elasticstack_kibana_security_list (Resource)

Manages Kibana security lists (also known as value lists). Security lists are used by exception items to define sets of values for matching or excluding in security rules.

Relevant Kibana docs can be found [here](https://www.elastic.co/docs/api/doc/kibana/group/endpoint-security-lists-api).

## Notes

- Security lists define the type of data they can contain via the `type` attribute
- Once created, the `type` of a list cannot be changed
- Lists can be referenced by exception items to create more sophisticated matching rules
- The `list_id` is auto-generated if not provided

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "elasticstack_kibana_security_list" "ip_list" {
  space_id    = "default"
  name        = "Trusted IP Addresses"
  description = "List of trusted IP addresses for security rules"
  type        = "ip"
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `description` (String) Describes the security list.
- `name` (String) The name of the security list.
- `type` (String) Specifies the Elasticsearch data type of values the list contains. Valid values include: `binary`, `boolean`, `byte`, `date`, `date_nanos`, `date_range`, `double`, `double_range`, `float`, `float_range`, `geo_point`, `geo_shape`, `half_float`, `integer`, `integer_range`, `ip`, `ip_range`, `keyword`, `long`, `long_range`, `shape`, `short`, `text`.

### Optional

- `deserializer` (String) Determines how retrieved list item values are presented. By default, list items are presented using Handlebars expressions based on the type.
- `id` (String) The unique identifier of the security list (auto-generated by Kibana if not specified).
- `list_id` (String) The value list's human-readable identifier.
- `meta` (String) Placeholder for metadata about the value list as JSON string.
- `serializer` (String) Determines how uploaded list item values are parsed. By default, list items are parsed using named regex groups based on the type.
- `space_id` (String) An identifier for the space. If space_id is not provided, the default space is used.
- `version` (Number) The document version number.

### Read-Only

- `created_at` (String) The timestamp of when the list was created.
- `created_by` (String) The user who created the list.
- `immutable` (Boolean) Whether the list is immutable.
- `tie_breaker_id` (String) Field used in search to ensure all containers are sorted and returned correctly.
- `updated_at` (String) The timestamp of when the list was last updated.
- `updated_by` (String) The user who last updated the list.
- `version_id` (String) The version id, normally returned by the API when the document is retrieved. Use it to ensure updates are done against the latest version.
