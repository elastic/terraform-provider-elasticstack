# Resource: elasticstack_elasticsearch_security_system_user

Updates system user's password and enablement. See, https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/built-in-users.html
Since this resource is to manage built-in users, destroy will not delete the underlying Elasticsearch and will only remove it from Terraform state.

## Example Usage

```terraform
provider "elasticstack" {
  elasticsearch {}
}

resource "elasticstack_elasticsearch_security_system_user" "kibana_system" {
  username = "kibana_system"

  // For details on how to generate the hashed password see https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/security-api-put-user.html#security-api-put-user-request-body
  password_hash = "$2a$10$rMZe6TdsUwBX/TA8vRDz0OLwKAZeCzXM4jT3tfCjpSTB8HoFuq8xO"

  elasticsearch_connection {
    endpoints = ["http://localhost:9200"]
    username  = "elastic"
    password  = "changeme"
  }
}
```
